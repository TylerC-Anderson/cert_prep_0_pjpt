# PJPT — Practical Jr. Pen Tester (Study Notes)

Here are the notes I am using while I prepare for the PJPT, which I am scheduled to take the week of December 7, 2025.

**Please Note**: These notes are a work in progress! There WILL be things missing which will be filled as I move through the course. There may even be some misconceptions that I will update.

I redacted (and continue to redact) all flags and bug bounty practice data.

Please let me know if you spot an misconceptions, have any pointers, or have any other questions or concerns!


## Directory Guide
- `PJPT Certificate Requisites and Prep.md` — overview of exam criteria, and list of recommended and expected courses.
- `Practical Ethical Hacking/` — Notes on TCM-Security's course, _Practical Ethical Hacking_.  Subdirectories are grouped by the stage in the exploit lifecycle that they best fit. There is also a directory for labs (`0_Labs`) that were a part of the course, which will also include the capstones, once completed.
- `External Pentest Playbook/` — Will become a quick reference shortlist of cheatsheets, organized in the order of the exploitation lifecycle. This is to counteract the fact that (inevitably) in the _Practical Ethical Hacking_ master notes, there is some overlap in the lifecycle, e.g. that `burpsuite` can be for both active enumeration and passive recon.
- `VulnBoxes/` — walk-throughs for practice labs that are sourced externally from the course (HTB, Kioptrix, etc.)
- `OPTIONAL/` — supplemental reading and exercises, most of which I pick up to learn the gaps I have before moving on, so these may not be complete even by the time I sit the exam.
