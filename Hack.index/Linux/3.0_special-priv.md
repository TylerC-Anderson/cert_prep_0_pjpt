State
- User has special privileges without full root:
  - Member of docker / lxd groups
  - Capabilities set via setcap
  - Read access to sensitive logs or backups

Goal → Turn special privilege into full root.

### IF YOU SEE:

    → Container escape → root

If user is in lxd group →
    → Mount host FS → root

If binaries have dangerous capabilities →
    → Abuse capabilities → root

If logs contain credentials →
    → Reuse creds → sudo or SSH

If backup directories accessible →
    → Extract shadow / ssh keys
