State
- You have a user with privilege-bearing attributes:
  - SPNs
  - Delegation (unconstrained, constrained, RBCD)
  - Write permissions (GenericWrite, GenericAll)
  - GPO or OU modification rights

Goal → Convert attribute-based privilege into actual escalation.

### IF YOU SEE:

If BloodHound shows privilege edges (shortest path, write privileges) →
    → Follow BH recommendations  
    → [[2_Enumeration/Post-Compromise Enumeration/Active Directory/Bloodhound and Plumhound Enumeration]]

If SPNs are present →
    → Perform kerberoasting  
    → [[2_Enumeration/Post-Compromise Enumeration/Active Directory/Kerberoasting]]  
    → Crack resulting tickets → [[3_Exploitation/Hashcracking]]

If delegation present →
    → Abuse ticketing path  
    → [[3_Exploitation/Post-Compromise Exploitation/Golden Tickets]]

If ACL rights exist over users/groups/GPOs →
    → Modify target → escalate  
    → [[3_Exploitation/Post-Compromise Exploitation/LNK File Attack]]  
    → [[3_Exploitation/Post-Compromise Exploitation/GPP Attack AKA cPassword Attacks]]

If credential material is accessible via scripts/services →
    → Extract secrets  
    → [[3_Exploitation/Post-Compromise Exploitation/Mimikatz]]
