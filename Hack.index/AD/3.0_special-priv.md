    → Follow BH recommendations

If SPNs are present →
    → Perform kerberoasting  
    → [[2_Studies/Courses/Current/CERTPREP - PJPT-Practical Jr Pen Tester/Practical Ethical Hacking/2_Enumeration/Post-Compromise Enumeration/Active Directory/Kerberoasting]]  
    → Crack resulting tickets → [[2_Studies/Courses/Current/CERTPREP - PJPT-Practical Jr Pen Tester/Practical Ethical Hacking/3_Exploitation/Hashcracking]]

If delegation present →
    → Abuse ticketing path  
    → [[2_Studies/Courses/Current/CERTPREP - PJPT-Practical Jr Pen Tester/Practical Ethical Hacking/3_Exploitation/Post-Compromise Exploitation/Golden Tickets]]

If ACL rights exist over users/groups/GPOs →
    → Modify target → escalate
