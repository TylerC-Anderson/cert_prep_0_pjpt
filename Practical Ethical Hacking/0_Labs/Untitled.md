Hi Chase. I applied for the Junior Penetration Tester role at Black Lantern just now and addressed my cover letter to you, hope that's okay.

I wanted to reach out because I really admire the philosophy and mindset that BLS seems to embody. Iâ€™d love the chance to learn from you and the team if possible, regardless of where my application lands. The passion for craft, integrity, and kinship reads clear to me, and I'm sure I'd learn a lot. 

Hope you had a great weekend, and look forward to connecting.
