## Overview

Burp Suite is a Layer 7 (and occasionally Layer 6) application, that is an HTTP(S) proxy and toolkit that intercepts, captures, inspects, modifies, and automates client–server web traffic.

It’s used to discover, reproduce, and exploit application-layer vulnerabilities in web apps and APIs—basically, analyze requests/responses, fuzz inputs, replay flows, and validate security issues.

## Usage

#### Enumeration:

Burp can be used to look through `Target` tab to find additional information on target infra and tech.
## Setup

*mise en place*:
- Have a Kali or other pentesting VM installed and ready to go. If prepackaged, Burp Suite likely is already installed there, update it.
- You'll also need a web browser like `Firefox`, and the `Foxy Proxy` `Firefox` extension

*init*:
- For your browser, set either `Foxy Proxy` or browser Network settings to the loopback address (`127.0.0.1`), also ensure it's set for `HTTPS`/`use this proxy for all protocols`
- go to `https://burp`, click "Advanced" > "accept risk and continue" when given the cert warning > Top right "CA Certificate" to DL Burp's `cacert.der`
- Back in Browser settings > Privacy/Security settings > View Certificates > Import > the `cacert.der` you downloaded > both checkboxes of `Trust this CA to identify websites` and `Trust this CA to identify email users`
