## Quick-Use

**Workflow**:

From `burp-suite`:
- Ensure foxy proxy is on and pointed to localhost (127.0.0.1)
- ensure `burp-suite > proxy > intercept` is off, then navigate to target site -> login page
- enable `intercept`
- send a test through the login portal (e.g. test@test.com:test for UN:PW pair)
- check resulting API call that was intercepted in `burp-suite`
- `ctrl+i` to send API call to `intruder` > nav to `intruder`
- check `intruder > positions`, if any green > click clear

*The workflow branches to either `credential stuffing` or `password spraying` here*

- *Credential Stuffing*:
    - for each of the username and password:
        - highlight whole string -> `Add ยง` ("Add position")
    - for a 1:1 pairing of two fields (i.e. 1 username to the equivalent index from the passwords list, as opposed to 1:all which would be each username in list is tried against all passwords from wordlist), change Attack Type to `Pitchfork`.
    - Nav to `paylods`, then:
        - for set1 (i.e. what you're adding for position 1 === usernames) -> add list of users to `Payload Options [Simple list]`
        - for set2 (i.e. what you're adding for position 2 === passwords) -> add wordlist of passwords to `Payload Options [Simple list]`
- *Password Spraying*: **NOTE**: This can lock out users from AD accounts, **NOT GOOD** to attempt without explicit prior authorization to conduct the attack. Even then, you will want to send 1 or 2, wait an appropriate amount of time for the customer's lockout policy, then send another 1 or 2 attempts
    - for the username:
        - highlight whole string -> `Add ยง` ("Add position")
    - for an all:1 pairing of username:password fields (i.e. each username to a single password, as opposed to 1:all which would be each username in list is tried against all passwords from a wordlist), change Attack Type to `Sniper`.
    - Nav to `paylods`, then:
        - for set1 (i.e. what you're adding for position 1 === usernames) -> add list of users to `Payload Options [Simple list]`
        - for set2 (i.e. what you're adding for position 2 === passwords) -> add wordlist of passwords to `Payload Options [Simple list]`

*For either `cred stuffing` or `password sprays`:*

- click `Start attack`
- Look for the following in Attack results:
    - status change (e.g. from `200` (OK) to `301` (REDIRECT) or other)
    - Significant response length change
    - Can pause attack and add failure message to `Intruder > Options: Grep - Match` to provide a message in the results that clearly states failure

*Tools*:
- `burp-suite` - allows for credential stuffing on web-apps 

## General

**Objectives**:
Attempt an online [[Brute-Force Attacks|brute-force attack]] of a site using a web-app testing tool, such as `burp-suite`, to attempt to login as a known or potential default user, using either leaked credentials (`credential stuffing`) or possible passwords (`password spraying`)
