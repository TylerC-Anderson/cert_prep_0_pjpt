## General

**Objectives**:
Flexible vulnerability that can be used to chain vulns together. Allows one to exec Javascript in a victim's browser.

**Overview**:
3 types of XSS:
- *Reflected* - injection payload is included in the API response to a request made by user
    - Can only target one's self, unless payload can be included in the URI which would then be deliverable via social engineering to click the malicious link
- *Stored* - Much more powerful, payload is stored in DB then retrieved and executed later
    - Higher impact vuln, more easily able to target other users
- *DOM-Based* - Everything happens locally in browser
    - Client-side has vulnerabilities that allows untrusted Javascript to be executed
    - differs from the above two as it's a client side vuln, instead of a server-side vuln (the above two are server-side)
