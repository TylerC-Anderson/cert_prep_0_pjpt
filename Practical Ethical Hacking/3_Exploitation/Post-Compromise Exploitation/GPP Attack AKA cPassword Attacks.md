## Quick-Use

**Commands**:

*Tools*:
- `gpp-decrypt` - cracks cPassword hashes
- `auxiliary/smb_enum_gpp` - also cracks cPassword hashes, but automates looking for the xml file with the password hash

## General

**Objectives**:


**Overview**:
Older attack, but may still be relevant

- Group Policy Preferences (GPP) allowed admins to create policies using embedded credentials
- Creds were encrypted and placed in a "cPassword"
- Cred encryption Key was accidentally released
- Patched in MS14-025, but does not prevent previous uses, so *still relevant for pentests*

## Mitigations

- PATCH! This should have been fixed in KB2962486
- Then also delete the old GPP xml file stored in the SYSVOL if still present
