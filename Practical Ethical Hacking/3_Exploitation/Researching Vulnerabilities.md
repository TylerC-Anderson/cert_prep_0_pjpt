## Quick-Use

**Commands**:

*Tools*:
- `google.com`
- `Exploit-db.com` - Website with exploits POC code snippets
- `searchsploit` - good for offline

## General

**Objectives**:
1. Systematically gather information on prime targets for exploitation, and evaluate them based on the following criteria:
    - *ease of exploitation*
    - *detectability/stealth/operational risk*
    - *scope of impact*
    - *Post-Exploitation value* (i.e. can you pivot or PrivEsc from it).

2. Then, generate a ranked shortlist of the actionable targets (*and their vulns*) that balance those criteria.
3. Then, find exploits that have been published for those vulns



**Overview**: Typically, the juiciest targets are:
- [[HTTP and HTTPS Enumeration|Port 80]]
- [[HTTP and HTTPS Enumeration|Port 443]]
- [[Enumerating SMB|Port 139/445]]
