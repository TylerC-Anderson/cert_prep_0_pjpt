## Quick-Use

**Commands**:
- `hydra` usage: `hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/examplewordlist.txt`

*Tools*:
- `hydra` - pw/hash cracker 
- `john` - hashcracker
- `hash-identifier` - Identifies type of hash
- `metasploit` - `search` for password scanners, e.g. `auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login`

## General

**Objectives**:
Generally test password strength by bypassing authentication for further exploitation during an engagement or CTF.

Good for also checking blue-team capabilities to advise on them later. If caught -> kudos, if not caught -> needs remediation

**Overview**:
*Brute Force Attacks* -> The act of attacking password- or hash-based authentication measures by testing many candidate credentials or keys. 

This practice covers *exhaustive brute force* (trying all possible combinations), *dictionary attacks* (testing common passwords), *hybrid/mangling attacks* (checking through wordlist + predictable mods to the words in wordlist), and *credential-stuffing* (trying reusing default credentials or leaked UN/PW pairs that have not been changed).

Attacks can be online or offline:
- *Online* - Against live service - can be constrained by rate limits, and network defenses/countermeasures - V LOUD
- *Offline* - Against captured hashes or hash dumps - safer to run fast and using all tools at your disposal such as GPUs and specialized cracking tools
## Glossary

- **Exhaustive brute force**: try every possible combination for a given charset/length (guaranteed but slow).
- **Dictionary attack**: try entries from a curated list of common passwords.
- **Hybrid/mangling**: dictionary entries plus automated transformations (leet, append numbers, capitalization).
- **Credential stuffing**: reuse of breached username:password pairs across sites.
- **Offline cracking**: attacker has password hashes — can attempt millions of guesses/sec using GPUs/KDF attacks.
- **Rainbow tables**: precomputed hash→password maps (less useful against salted hashes).
- **KDF / slow hashes**: bcrypt/Argon2/scrypt designed to slow offline cracking.
- **Rate-limiting / lockout / MFA / CAPTCHA**: common online mitigations.
