## Quick-Use


**KEY TAKEAWAYS**: 
1. Know the differences between `_` (*non-staged*) and `/` (*staged*)
2. If you KNOW the exploit is right, then maybe the payload is wrong, try a diff payload

*Tools*:
- `Metasploit` - modules have both non-staged (`meterpreter_reverse_tcp`) and staged (`meterpreter/reverse_tcp`)
    - the underscore (`_`) indicates that it's literally one package (non-staged), the slash `/` indicates that first `meterpreter` is sent, **THEN** `reverse_tcp` is sent.

## General

**Objectives**:

Send a payload which delivers exploit shellcode to gain a reverse or binding shell.

**Overview**: 

*2 Types of Payloads*:
- `Non-Staged`: Exploit shellcode sent all at once, without prep
    - Large in size, hit-or-miss
        - *Metasploit example*:
            - `windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`
- `Staged`: Sends shellcode in stages
    - can be less stable, but works more often
        - *Metasploit example*:
            - `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
