## Overview

Leaked credentials are a great way into a target, so long as credentials are used on the domains within the scope.

Once you know the breached passwords, you can use them to do a *Credential Stuffing* attack, where you use patterns found in the breached passwords to predict what the user's next password will be. -> *look for repeat offenders in credential leaks, those are good targets*

## Quick-Use

*Tools*

- [breach-parse](https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse) - parses a provided file of breached/leaked creds
- `DeHashed` - web tool to search through breached or leaked creds - Priced, but **INCREDIBLE** value. `dehashed` (alias of [password-enumeration.py](https://github.com/TeneBrae93/offensivesecurity/blob/main/password-enumeration.py)) also can resolve passwords using a DeHashed API key, API credits are $3/100 credits.
